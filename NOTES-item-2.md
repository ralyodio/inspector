# NOTES — item 2 (internal advance endpoint + discovery)

**Status: stopped before the endpoint. The Inspector-local half is built and tested; the
endpoint itself is blocked on a backend surface that does not exist.**

This is a §7 stop, taken on "the work needs a design decision this document does not answer"
rather than on a failing gate. Every gate that applies to what shipped is green.

## The blocker

Item 2's endpoint is specified as three steps:

1. `acquireWorkLease` — a backend call, before any work.
2. Exactly one idempotent step — Inspector-local.
3. Report through `reportDiscovery` — a backend call.

Steps 1 and 3 have **no wire path from the Inspector**, and building one means inventing a
cross-repo contract.

What I checked, and what I found:

| question | answer |
| --- | --- |
| Are the state-machine functions reachable from a Convex client? | No. Every export in `convex/serverConnectionRequests.ts` is `internal*`. `internal*` functions are unreachable from any client, by design. |
| Does the Inspector hold a Convex admin/deploy key? | No. `grep` for `CONVEX_ADMIN`, `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`, `anyApi`, `makeFunctionReference` across `mcpjam-inspector/server` returns nothing. The only Convex env vars are `CONVEX_URL` and `CONVEX_HTTP_URL`. |
| How does the Inspector reach backend internals today? | Only through the backend's `/internal/v1/*` HTTP routes, gated by `INSPECTOR_SERVICE_TOKEN`. See `server/services/internal-backend.ts`, which is the shared plumbing for exactly this. |
| Does a `/internal/v1/server-connections/*` route exist? | **No.** `grep -n "/internal/v1"` in `convex/http.ts` lists 14 route paths; none is a server-connection route. `grep serverConnection` across the whole backend finds the module, the schema table, the lib helpers, and its tests — and nothing in `http.ts`. |
| Is the Inspector's `ConvexHttpClient` a way in? | No. `routes/v1/convex-client.ts` constructs it with a **user** auth token, which can only call public functions. |

So the brief's "report the result through the guarded backend mutation" has no guarded mutation
to report through yet. The backend HTTP routes that would expose the state machine are part of
"the REST routes", which §8 explicitly defers until item 1 is merged and deployed — which cannot
happen while this agent runs.

Writing the endpoint anyway would mean choosing, unreviewed: the route paths, the request and
response envelopes, the error-code vocabulary, and how a lease id round-trips. A human would then
have to match all of it on the backend side. Per §1 ("guess at a design fork. Stop instead") that
is the thing not to do.

## What shipped instead

Two modules that are fully determined by the brief, commit to no cross-repo contract, and are
exactly what the endpoint will consume when someone builds it.

### `server/middleware/internal-service-auth.ts`

Inbound `INSPECTOR_SERVICE_TOKEN` verification — the direction the Inspector has never needed
before (every existing use sends the header outbound). A deliberate mirror of the backend's
`convex/lib/serviceToken.ts` in its `header-only` mode.

- Constant-time compare over **SHA-256 digests of both sides**. `timingSafeEqual` throws on a
  length mismatch, so comparing raw tokens forces a length branch that leaks the secret's length
  to anyone who can time it. Two digests are always 32 bytes, so there is nothing to branch on.
- Fails closed when `INSPECTOR_SERVICE_TOKEN` is unset or empty. Unconfigured must mean "nobody is
  authorized", never "no guard".
- Does **not** implement the backend's `header-or-bearer` mode, which that file says new routes
  must not adopt — so it cannot be reached for by accident.
- 401 body is identical for absent, malformed, and wrong tokens, and never reveals whether a named
  request id exists.
- The configured token is **trimmed**, and whitespace-only counts as unset. The presented header was
  already trimmed, so leaving the configured value untrimmed made the two sides asymmetric: a
  deployment whose secret picked up a trailing newline rejected every correctly presented token —
  fail-closed, but a total outage that reads as a credential mismatch. **The backend's
  `convex/lib/serviceToken.ts` has the same asymmetry and should get the same treatment**; not
  changed from here, because a silent one-sided edit is the drift the mirror exists to prevent.

11 tests.

### `server/services/server-connection-discovery.ts`

The bounded, unauthenticated preflight and its classification, using the SDK's `probeMcpServer` —
the same prober the server doctor runs, so no new prober.

The prober rather than the whole doctor. Classification reads `probe` and nothing else, so the
doctor's tool/resource/prompt enumeration is work discovery never looks at — and the doctor's
connect step dials through MCPClientManager's own transport, which takes no `fetchFn` and is
therefore the one outbound path the egress guard cannot reach (the same scope limit documented on
`routes/shared/conformance.ts`). Dropping it removes an unguarded socket.

**SSRF defence is two layers, and the first one alone is not enough.** This was wrong in the
original version of this branch and is worth spelling out:

1. `assertOutboundOAuthUrlAllowed` from `@mcpjam/sdk/oauth/node` is a pure RFC 6890 classifier over
   the URL's **hostname string**. It refuses literal private/loopback/link-local/CGNAT/multicast/
   documentation/NAT64-private/IPv4-mapped-private targets and non-http(s) schemes before any
   socket exists. What it cannot do — as `oauth/node.ts` says of it in as many words — is judge a
   bare public hostname: `evil.example` passes and can still resolve to `169.254.169.254`.
2. The probe therefore dials through `createGuardedFetch` (`server/utils/hosted-egress-guard.ts`,
   the same helper `routes/shared/conformance.ts` uses), which resolves the hostname, refuses
   private answers, and re-checks **every redirect hop**. The redirect half is not optional: a
   caller need not name the address they want reached — they can name a host they control and have
   it answer `302 Location: http://169.254.169.254/`.

One wrinkle worth knowing: `probeMcpServer` **catches** whatever `fetchFn` throws and reports it as
`status: "error"`, which classifies as retryable. Correct for a timeout, wrong for an egress
refusal — it would put an SSRF attempt on a retry schedule. So the guard's verdict is recorded as
it passes and consulted before the probe's own account. A blocked target is `terminal`; a resolver
**outage** is `retryable`, because DNS blipping is our infrastructure trouble and not a verdict
about the user's server.

Residual gap, accepted repo-wide rather than invented here: the guard validates the DNS answer and
the HTTP client then resolves again, leaving a check-vs-connect (TOCTOU) window.
`hosted-egress-guard.ts` documents that punt for every egress path in this server; closing it needs
connection pinning at the infra layer, not a second private copy here.

Classification, mapped off the probe status:

| probe | outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `ready` (initialize succeeded, no credential) | `discovered` / `none` |
| `oauth_required` + an actionable challenge | `discovered` / `oauth` |
| `oauth_required` + nothing actionable | `discovered` / `unsupported` |
| `reachable` (answered, but not MCP) | `terminal`, `NOT_AN_MCP_SERVER` |
| `error` (probe exhausted its retry policy) | `retryable` — **no discovery reported** |

The `error` → `retryable` arm is the one that matters most and has an explicit test: reporting
`unsupported` for a server that was down for a minute would permanently mislabel a server that
works.

### The `oauth` vs `unsupported` test, and a bug that made it a no-op

An earlier revision accepted **either** a discovered `authorizationServerMetadataUrl` **or** a
non-empty `registrationStrategies` list as proof of an actionable challenge. That inverted the whole
test. `sdk/src/server-probe.ts` returns `registrationStrategies: ["preregistered"]` from the branch
it takes when metadata discovery **threw** — which is exactly the manual-bearer and unknown-scheme
case — so the list was non-empty precisely when discovery had failed, and `unsupported` became
unreachable. A manual-bearer server would have been routed into `awaiting_authorization` with no
consent screen to open.

Now the only sufficient signal is a non-empty `authorizationServerMetadataUrl` — somewhere to
actually send the user — plus a `Bearer` scheme in the challenge when one is present. The
manual-bearer test carries the real `["preregistered"]` shape so the disjunct cannot come back.

Worth recording why the original tests did not catch it: they asserted against a hand-written
fixture (`registrationStrategies: []`) that the real prober never produces for that case. The
fixture agreed with the code and both were wrong about the world.

### Transport and bounds

- **HTTPS-only for public targets.** `assertOutboundOAuthUrlAllowed` judges addresses, not
  transport, and accepts `http:`. Plaintext to a public host is refused here; loopback keeps its
  plaintext exception under the explicit opt-in, because `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp` is the
  local-development product.
- **Bounded for real.** `timeoutMs` bounds ONE request and the probe makes several, so a caller
  value is clamped to `MAX_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` and the whole step races an absolute
  `DISCOVERY_DEADLINE_MS`. Without the deadline a deliberately slow target holds a work lease for
  the sum of every request the probe chooses to make.

27 tests. The two SSRF cases run through the **real** `createGuardedFetch` with an injected resolver
and base fetch, not a mock that throws on cue — the DNS case asserts nothing was dialled at all, and
the redirect case asserts exactly one request, so the private hop provably was never reached. A
third case checks a public-to-public redirect still succeeds, since refusing redirects wholesale
would be its own bug.

## Open question a human needs to settle: XAA

The brief lists four things that must classify as `unsupported`: basic, manual bearer, XAA, and
unknown. Three of those fall out of one test — "did discovery find an authorization server we
could actually send someone to?" Basic names none because the scheme has no concept of one;
manual-bearer servers challenge with `Bearer` and publish no metadata because there is no flow to
run; unknown schemes name none either.

**XAA does not.** An XAA server challenges with `Bearer` and *does* publish authorization server
metadata, so the current classifier calls it `oauth`. Separating the two needs an XAA-specific
marker in the discovered metadata, and I could not find a settled one — the SDK has a full
`sdk/src/xaa/` flow, but nothing in the probe path that identifies an XAA server from its
challenge or its metadata (`grep` for a `www-authenticate` scheme or an `xaa_required` style
signal in `sdk/src` finds only DCR client-secret helpers).

Left deliberately misclassified, with the gap named in a comment at the decision site. A guessed
detector is worse than a known gap here: the failure mode of a wrong detector is refusing servers
that actually work, and it would be attributed to the server rather than to us.

## Test-config change worth a glance

`server/vitest.config.ts` gained an alias and an inline entry for `@mcpjam/sdk/oauth/node`.

Not optional and not cosmetic: the aliases in that file are **prefix** replacements, so without
its own entry the specifier rewrote to `sdk/src/index.ts/oauth/node` and failed to resolve. Every
other SDK subpath the server imports already has the same pair of entries. No existing test's
expectations were changed.

## Gates

```sh
npm run build -w @mcpjam/sdk              # clean
cd mcpjam-inspector && npx vitest run --project server
                                          # 369 files passed | 1 skipped
                                          # 5259 tests passed | 22 skipped  ← 0 failures
```

Prettier (v2, `--trailing-comma all`) was run on only the files this branch creates or edits.

**`npm test` — the whole workspace — is RED, and it is red on `origin/main` too.** Three client
tests fail; this diff touches only `mcpjam-inspector/server/**` and two root markdown files, and
the `client` vitest project is rooted at `./client`, so nothing here can reach them. Verified
directly rather than assumed: `SwarmsTab.perClientEnvLaunch.test.tsx` ("refuses the whole launch
when one of the two environments is gone") fails identically at `8cedc9e`, i.e. `origin/main`
with this branch's commit absent. The other two surface only under full-suite parallel load and
pass when their files are run alone, which is the signature of flake rather than breakage.

Not fixed here. They are unrelated client component tests, and making them pass would mean
editing existing tests' expectations — a §7 stop condition in its own right. Flagged so the red
is not mistaken for something this branch did.

## What is left for whoever picks this up

1. Backend: expose the state machine over `/internal/v1/server-connections/*` (lease acquire and
   release, discovery report, validation report), service-token gated, in the shape the existing
   `/internal/v1/*` routes use. This is the design decision.
2. Inspector: a typed client for those routes in `server/services/`, alongside `internal-backend.ts`.
3. Inspector: `server/routes/internal/` mounted in `server/app.ts` beside the other route groups,
   guarded by `internalServiceAuthMiddleware()`, doing lease → one step → report and returning 200
   with a reason when the lease is refused (`leased`, `not-live`, `attempts-exhausted`).
4. Then item 3's validation step, which stacks on all of the above and is otherwise blocked for
   the same reason — see NOTES-item-3.md.
