 * Replay the class monitors against known history.
 *
 * A monitor is only trustworthy if it fires on the incident it was written for

 * keeps reading #mcpjam-alerts, so it is not optional.

 * THE CARDINAL RULE, learned twice the hard way: a case must express the
 * monitor's REAL predicate, never a proxy for it. Every query below is built by
 * `spikePredicate` / `noveltyPredicate`, which mirror the shipped definitions
 * clause for clause — including the production-environment filter, the
 * fingerprint expression, and the recent-hour-only maxStatus. An earlier
 * version hand-rolled the noise check with a hardcoded baseline and no
 * fingerprint grouping; it could have passed while production paged.

// The status-agnostic 1,000/hr rule exists because reclassifying a class from
// 5xx to 4xx must not make it invisible — which is exactly what happened when
// PR #3948 moved upstream auth rejections from 500 to 403 and left the 08-06
// incident undetectable by the two status/radius-gated rules.
//
// This asserts the bar still sits clear of ORGANIC 4xx traffic. If real 4xx
// ever approaches 1,000/hr the bar must be raised BEFORE it starts paging, and
// learning that here rather than from a false page at 3am is the point.
//
// It has to measure the MAX, not a percentile. Rule 1 fires on any single
// class-hour above the bar, so the only quantity that validates headroom is the
// largest one. A percentile is robust to incidents but blind to exactly the
// event that matters — one organic hour crossing 1,000 is 1-in-~1,000 and moves
// p99 not at all. (An earlier revision used p99 for incident-robustness and was
// wrong for this reason.)
//
// Incidents are excluded by explicit enumeration rather than by trying to
// classify them statistically. Separating "organic spike" from "incident spike"
// automatically requires precisely the judgement the monitor exists to make, so
// this file does what it already does for history: names them.
//
// A NEW hour above the bar SHOULD fail here. That is not a false alarm — it is
// the guard demanding a human decide which case it is:
//   - incident  → add its window below, exactly like adding a fixture
//   - organic   → raise the bar in the monitor BEFORE it starts false-paging
//
// Rolling window, unlike the pinned fixtures above, is deliberate: this asks
// "is traffic growing toward the bar", which is meaningless against a fixed
// instant. Do not "fix" it into a fixture — that silently stops the trend check.
// Hour bins, because the exclusion is applied AFTER aggregation. APL will not
// filter `_time` by a negated or disjoint range (`not(_time between …)` and
// `_time < a or _time >= b` are both query errors — its time-range optimizer
// requires a single contiguous interval). Filtering the projected bin column
// sidesteps that, and is bin-precise rather than approximate.
