/**
 * App surface manifests — what screens the inspector has, and what a user
 * does on each.
 *
 * This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for three things that used to drift apart:
 *   - `KNOWN_APP_TAB_SEGMENTS` (client/src/lib/app-navigation.ts), which
 *     decides where `ui_navigate` can go;
 *   - the app atlas in the agent's system prompt (`buildAppAtlas`), which is
 *     how the model knows the app exists at all;
 *   - the route↔surface coverage tests, which fail CI when a new screen
 *     ships without either of the above.
 *
 * Shared, not client-only: the server builds the atlas into the system
 * prompt and never sees the client bundle.
 *
 * ## Adding a screen
 *
 * Add a manifest here and a `kind: "screen"` entry in the route table
 * (client/src/lib/app-routes.ts) pointing at its `id`. The coverage tests
 * fail both ways — a screen route with no manifest, and a manifest no route
 * renders — so an agent-invisible screen cannot ship by omission.
 *
 * `purpose` and `userActivities` are model-facing prose. Write them for
 * someone who has never seen the app: they are the entire basis on which the
 * agent decides where to go.
