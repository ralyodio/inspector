/**
 * Convex bearer resolution for the public /api/v1 surface.
 *
 * Convex client auth (`ConvexHttpClient.setAuth`) and several Convex HTTP
 * routes are JWT-only, but /api/v1 callers authenticate with WorkOS API keys
 * (`sk_…`). For those requests the Inspector exchanges its service-token
 * delegation (the same `x-mcpjam-acting-as` / `x-mcpjam-acting-in-org` trust
 * model used by `authorizeBatch`) for a short-lived org-scoped JWT minted by
 * the backend's `POST /web/delegated-token`. JWT callers pass through
 * untouched.
 *
 * The minted token is an internal credential: it is held in this process
 * (request flow + background eval task closures) and is never returned to
 * the API caller.

 * What the backend cannot clamp is a query that is not org-scoped at all:
 * `organizations:getMyOrganizations` answers "every org this HUMAN belongs to",
 * which for an `sk_` key bound to one org is strictly more than the key may
 * see. A route serving such a query must intersect the result with this.
 *
 * Read the AUTH METHOD, not the presence of `mcpjamOrganizationId`: a session
 * JWT caller can carry the var too (it is the org their UI is looking at), and
 * clamping them to it would hide the other orgs they legitimately belong to —
 * the exact list this endpoint exists to return.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED. A delegated caller whose org cannot be resolved throws rather
 * than returning `undefined`, because `undefined` here means "confined to
 * nothing" — the caller would skip the clamp entirely and receive everything.
 * The two states are opposites and must not share a return value. Today this
 * is also unreachable, since `getConvexBearerForRequest` mints first and
 * `delegationContext` rejects the same broken state (with this same code); the
