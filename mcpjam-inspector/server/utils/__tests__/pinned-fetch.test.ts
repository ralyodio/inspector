/**
 * The pinned transport adapter, and the one property that makes it safe to use.
 *
 * `server-connection-discovery` decides `terminal` vs `retryable` by
 * `instanceof BlockedEgressTargetError`. An earlier revision of this adapter
 * flattened every `OAuthProxyError` into a plain `Error`, which erased that
 * distinction: an SSRF refusal became indistinguishable from a timeout, so a
 * target we had already refused went straight back onto a retry schedule.
 *
 * THESE TESTS DRIVE THE REAL TRANSPORT. The adapter tells a refusal from a
 * failure by matching the SDK's message, because `OAuthProxyError` carries only
 * a `status` — 400 for both "resolves to a private or reserved address" and
 * "request timeout", which are opposite verdicts. Matching prose across a
 * package boundary is only safe if something notices when the prose changes,
 * and that is what these are: they call `createPinnedFetch` at real reserved
 * addresses and assert the class that comes back, so a reworded SDK message
 * fails here instead of silently downgrading a refusal.
