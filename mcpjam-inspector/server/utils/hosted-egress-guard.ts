/**
 * The one place that decides whether the hosted inspector is allowed to dial a
 * URL a caller handed it.
 *
 * Hosted, the inspector's backend sits on a shared cloud network, so any route
 * that takes a target URL from a request is an SSRF primitive: point it at
 * `http://169.254.169.254/` and the response is IAM credentials. Locally
 * (CLI/desktop) the exact opposite is true — dialing `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
 * IS the product — so every check here is gated on `HOSTED_MODE` and the
 * host-tier distinction `isBlockedEgressHost` already draws:
 *
 *   - Always blocked: cloud-metadata addresses and their DNS aliases,
 *     link-local, and the unspecified address. Never a legitimate target
 *     anywhere, in any mode.
 *   - Blocked only when hosted: loopback, `.localhost`, RFC-1918, CGNAT, and
 *     IPv6 ULA.
 *
 * Validating the URL a caller NAMED is not enough on its own, because a caller
 * does not have to name the address they want reached — they can name a host
 * they control and have it answer `302 Location: http://169.254.169.254/`. So
 * `createGuardedFetch` re-checks every hop; a guard that only inspects the first
 * URL is a guard against typos, not against an attacker.
 *
 * Two things this guard deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 *   - It judges the TARGET URL, never an outgoing `Host` header. The protocol
 *     conformance suite sends rebinding-style Host headers on purpose (the
 *     `localhost-host-rebinding-rejected` checks are how it grades a server's
 *     own defenses); treating those as egress would break the suite it is
 *     meant to protect.
 *   - It does not close the check-vs-connect (TOCTOU) rebinding window: the
 *     DNS answer is validated, then the HTTP client resolves again. Narrowing
 *     that requires pinning the connection to the vetted IP, which belongs to
 *     infra-level egress policy — the same punt documented on the harness
 *     guard.
