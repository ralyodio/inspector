/**
 * MCPJam workspace built-in tools — the in-product surface of the shared
 * platform operation catalog (`@mcpjam/sdk/platform`).
 *
 * Each tool IS a `PlatformOperation`, adapted per the catalog's design
 * ("defined once and adapted per surface"): name, description, input schema,
 * and execute come from the operation — identical to the MCP worker's tools
 * — so the catalog ids registered in the backend `builtInTools` table are
 * the operation names, unchanged. The operations call the platform's own
 * `/api/v1`; in-app the injected `PlatformApiClient` self-dispatches into
 * this server's Hono app (see routes/web/mcpjam-platform-client.ts), so no
 * forked handler logic and no network hop.
 *
 * The one per-surface adaptation is ambient project scoping: every operation
 * takes an optional `project` selector that defaults to "most recently
 * updated" for external callers with no context. In a chat there IS ambient
 * context, so an omitted `project` defaults to the chat's project instead —
 * an input default, not a schema fork. An explicit `project` still works
 * (the agent may roam; authority is the caller's bearer either way), which
 * is why this is a default rather than a clamp.
 *
 * Approval policy: operations that open a connection to a saved MCP server
 * inherit the host's `requireToolApproval`, mirroring the blanket approval
 * MCP tools get from the orchestration layer. `list_project_servers` is a
 * pure platform read and never needs approval, like `web_search`.
 *
 * `execute` returns `{ error: string }` instead of throwing so the model can
 * relay problems conversationally instead of breaking the turn. Results are
 * capped before they reach model context (`MODEL_OUTPUT_CAP`).
