/**
 * A `fetch`-shaped front door onto the SDK's DNS-pinned OAuth transport.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `utils/hosted-egress-guard.ts` classifies a hostname's DNS
 * answer and then hands the URL to an HTTP client that resolves it a SECOND
 * time — its own docblock says so. Between those two resolutions the answer can
 * change, which is the whole DNS-rebinding attack: name a host you control,
 * pass the check with a public address, and serve 169.254.169.254 to the
 * connection that actually happens.
 *
 * `@mcpjam/sdk/oauth/node` closes that window. It resolves once, refuses the
 * disallowed answers, and PINS the surviving addresses into the socket, so the
 * address that was checked is the address that gets connected. It re-validates
 * every redirect hop under the same rules (capped at five) and strips
 * credentials across origins.
 *
 * The mismatch this adapter fixes: `server-connection-discovery.ts` already
 * imports the SDK's classifier while dialling through the local guard — the
 * safe half without the half that makes it safe. The SDK entry that closes the
 * gap shipped one day before that module, so this is a wiring gap rather than a
 * disagreement about what is correct.
 *
 * SCOPE. Deliberately narrow. This is for probing an attacker-supplied MCP
 * server URL — the connection flow's discovery and validation steps. It is not
 * a general-purpose fetch: the SDK transport buffers the whole response body
 * (bounded) and cannot stream, so it must never be pointed at SSE or a large
 * download.
