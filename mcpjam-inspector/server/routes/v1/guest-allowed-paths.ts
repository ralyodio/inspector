// Guests get a NARROW allowlist of v1 routes — exactly the platform MCP tool
// surface the worker drives (see mcp/src/tools/platformTools.ts
// PLATFORM_CATALOG_OPERATIONS + show_servers). Everything else (tunnels,
// eval-ingest, oauth token import, export, /me) stays guest-rejected. This is
// default-deny: a newly-added v1 route is closed to guests until it earns a
// pattern here (and its own guest security review). The catalog reads in this
// list additionally relax the Convex /v1/* surface (publicApi/routes.ts
// authedV1) so the proxied reads succeed end-to-end.
// An allowlist entry is method-aware: `methods` omitted means any method is
// guest-allowed on that path (the historical behavior); a `methods` list
// restricts it. `eval-suites` is GET-only because the GET lists suites (a read)
// but POST /eval-suites CREATES a suite — a WRITE that must stay guest-denied.
