/**
 * `/api/v1/server-connections` — the public REST surface for connecting an MCP
 * server to a project.
 *
 * These four routes are thin: they forward the CALLER'S OWN bearer to the
 * backend's public connection functions, which is what makes the flow work
 * identically for a signed-in user, an API key, and a guest. The Inspector adds
 * no authority of its own here — a guest JWT is a registered Convex auth
 * provider, so the backend resolves the same actor either way and does the
 * ownership check itself.
 *
 * `handoffUrl` appears in the CREATE response and nowhere else, because the raw
 * handoff token exists exactly once, in the response that minted it. A status
 * read cannot rebuild it, and that is deliberate: a link a caller could re-fetch
 * at will would be a 60-minute browser credential sitting behind a pollable
 * endpoint.
