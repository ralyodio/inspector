/**
 * MCPJam Public API — v1 live-MCP surface (Inspector Node).
 *
 * Mounted at `/api/v1`. Resource-oriented, project-scoped routes that wrap the
 * same core helpers as `/api/web/*` (no forked handler logic) and emit the
 * canonical v1 envelope. Covers read diagnostics (validate/doctor/lists),
 * write operations (tools/call, prompts/get, resources/read, OAuth token
 * import, async eval runs — POST creates + detaches; agents poll the GET
 * routes for status, iteration results, and traces), and the catalog reads
 * (me/projects/servers/eval-suites/chat-sessions) proxied over the Convex
 * `/v1/*` surface so this is the ONE public host for the whole API.
