/**
 * The public agent's operation registry — one entry per tool, and the single
 * place a new tool is declared.
 *
 * WHY A REGISTRY. Adding an operation to this surface used to mean editing
 * five places that had no way of knowing about each other: the op list, the
 * idempotency set, the proposal describer, the system prompt, and the Slack
 * app's button-label table. Four of those were hand-maintained lookups keyed by
 * operation name, so the failure mode of forgetting one was silent — a write
 * left out of the idempotency set quietly loses retry safety, a proposal with
 * no describer renders its raw operation name at a human, a tool with no prompt
 * note is one the model never learns when to reach for.
 *
 * So the entry carries the metadata and everything else is DERIVED:
 *
 *   - `AGENT_API_OPERATIONS` / `AGENT_API_GATED_OPERATIONS` — the two tiers.
 *   - `WRITE_OPERATION_NAMES` — direct ∧ !readOnly, read off the operation's
 *     own `readOnly` flag rather than restated. The op catalog already knows
 *     which operations persist; asking it is not just less typing, it is the
 *     only version of this set that cannot drift.
 *   - the proposal's human-facing copy (`describe`, `buttonLabel`, `kind`,
 *     `confirmSeverity`), which now travels IN the response envelope so a host
 *     renders what the server decided instead of re-deriving it from an
 *     operation name it happens to recognise.
 *   - the system prompt's operation-specific guidance (`promptNotes`).
 *
 * TIERS. `direct` executes. `gated` validates, persists a proposal, and
 * returns an opaque id for a human to approve — the tier for anything that
 * SPENDS or reaches outside MCPJam. The discriminated union makes `proposal`
 * mandatory on a gated entry at the type level, so a gated op cannot be added
 * without saying what its approval prompt says.
 *
 * NOT AN AUTHORIZATION BOUNDARY. The tier decides which tool the model is
 * offered; the clamp, the delegated JWT, and the proposal claim are what make
 * the call safe. A registry edit widens the surface — review it as one.
