/**
 * The effective origin must survive from the capture decision all the way to
 * `webErrorMeta`, which is what `http.request.failed` reads.
 *
 * Before this, `webError` recomputed `originOf(normalized)` at serialization
 * time — the DECLARED catalog value. A failure reported through an
 * `mcpjam_internal` boundary is promoted to `mcpjam` and pages Sentry, but its
 * catalog slug is usually `ambiguous`, so the Axiom row said `ambiguous` for a
 * failure we had just paged ourselves for. That drift is why `origin=mcpjam`
 * never appeared in 30 days of production data, and why the MCPJam-fault
 * monitor had nothing to gate on.
