/**
 * The handoff page's back end.
 *
 * `/connect/server/<token>` is a page the user opens from a CLI, a Slack
 * message, or a Discord button. These routes are what it talks to, and the
 * shape is deliberate: THE BROWSER NEVER HOLDS A TOKEN.
 *
 * The claim call trades the single-use handoff token for a continuation token
 * that goes straight into an HttpOnly cookie. Every step after it — reading
 * state, choosing a project, cancelling — authenticates with that cookie, so
 * page JavaScript never sees a credential, a `document.cookie` read finds
 * nothing, and an XSS on this origin cannot lift the capability.
 *
 * The Inspector holds the service token and forwards only the continuation
 * DIGEST to the backend, so the raw value never leaves this process either.
 *
 * WHY POST FOR THE CLAIM. A GET would be claimed by anything that follows
 * links: a link preview crawler in the channel the handoff was posted to, a
 * prefetching browser, a corporate mail scanner. The claim is single-use, so
 * one of those consuming it would leave the real user with a dead link and no
 * explanation. Requiring a POST from the page's own script means only a real
 * visit claims it.
