/**
 * Launching a journey run, with no HTTP in it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SERVICE. The launch used to live inline in
 * `routes/web/swarm-runs.ts`, and everything it needs was reachable from the
 * request `Context` sitting in scope — the delegated bearer, the XAA issuer,
 * the caller context threaded into every authorize batch. That is exactly what
 * made it un-callable from anywhere else: `POST /api/v1/projects/:p/journeys/
 * :id/runs` needs the same 200 lines, and a second copy of a fan-out launcher
 * is not a thing to maintain. So the four request-derived values are now
 * PARAMETERS, resolved by whichever route is calling, and the launch itself
 * knows nothing about Hono.
 *
 * THE ORDERING RULE, which the comments below repeat where it bites: once
 * `createJourneyRun` returns, a durable run row exists. Anything that throws
 * after that point orphans it — a run in the database with no runner, visible
 * in the UI, advancing to nothing until the backend's stale-run cron reaps it.
 * So validation happens BEFORE the create, and everything after it is either
 * infallible or explicitly deferred into the detached runner.
 *
 * THE BEARER IS A THUNK, not a string. The runner detaches after the caller
 * gets its 202 and can fan out for hours; a delegated JWT lives about two.
 * `deps.bearerToken` is for the create, which happens inside the request.
 * `deps.getRunBearer` is for everything the runner does afterwards, and it is
 * re-resolved per unit of work rather than per outbound call — see
 * `swarm-runner.ts`.
