/**
 * `launchJourneyRun` — the launch, with the HTTP taken out of it.
 *
 * The extraction from `routes/web/swarm-runs.ts` exists so the v1 route can
 * reuse it rather than carry a second copy of a fan-out launcher. What these
 * pin is the ORDERING RULE that makes the function safe to call from either:
 *
 *   Once `createJourneyRun` returns, a DURABLE RUN ROW EXISTS. Anything that
 *   throws after that point orphans it — a run in the database with no runner,
 *   visible in the UI, advancing to nothing until the stale-run cron reaps it.
 *   So validation happens BEFORE the create, and the detached runner is started
 *   in a way that cannot throw back into the caller.
 *
 * And the DEDUPE rule, which is the difference between one billed run and two:
 * a replayed launch key must acknowledge the original and start NOTHING.
