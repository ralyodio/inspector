/**
 * The Inspector's client for the backend's connection routes.
 *
 * The assertions here are about TELLING FAILURES APART, because this client
 * sits between two things that both answer in HTTP and mean different things:
 * a backend that refused (409, 410 — normal races the worker must not retry)
 * and a call that never completed (a timeout, which must not be reported as if
 * the backend said something).
 *
 * The subtle one is the body read. A `fetch` that has RESOLVED has not
 * finished — the response headers arrived, the body has not — and the same
 * timeout still governs it. Swallowing every throw from `.json()` turned an
 * abort into `Backend call failed (200)`: a timeout wearing a status code from
 * a call that never delivered anything.
