/**
 * Project-environment launch resolution (reproducibility surfaces).
 *
 * An environment run never trusts browser-supplied server ids: the backend's
 * member-read query `projectEnvironments:resolveEnvironmentForLaunch` returns
 * the closed execution preview for ONE environment revision, and
 * `startTestSuiteRun` re-checks that revision plus the resolved host config and
 * effective server set (the `expectedEnvironment*` echoes) before inserting any
 * run row. So a tool snapshot from one revision can never pair with a Convex
 * run snapshot from another, AND a host-config rotation or attachment edit at
 * an UNCHANGED revision is caught as drift instead of silently executed.
 *
 * This module is target-agnostic — it lives under `services/environments/`,
 * not `services/evals/`, because eval launches and any future reproducibility
 * surface share it. Interactive per-turn resolution is a different contract
 * (live, override-aware) and belongs in a sibling runtime service, not here.
 *
 * Hand-mirrored contract (no codegen; string function refs like the rest of
 * the inspector→Convex surface) and deliberately deploy-skew tolerant: fields a
 * newer backend added are optional here so an older backend still parses.
