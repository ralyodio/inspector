/**
 * Preparing one browser authorization for a connection request.
 *
 * This is the network half of the OAuth step, and it lives here rather than in
 * Convex for the same reason discovery does: every request below dials a URL
 * the user supplied. Metadata discovery follows `.well-known` paths on that
 * host, registration POSTs to whatever `registration_endpoint` the metadata
 * names, and both are perfectly good SSRF primitives if they run somewhere
 * without a guard. The pinned transport — one DNS resolution, every answer
 * classified, the surviving addresses pinned into the socket, redirects
 * re-validated per hop — is Node-only and is here.
 *
 * WHAT LEAVES THIS MODULE, AND WHAT MUST NOT. It returns an authorization URL
 * for the browser to open, and a `codeVerifier` for the backend to store. Those
 * two must not swap places: the URL is meant to be navigated to, and the
 * verifier is the one value in PKCE that must never reach the browser, or the
 * proof-of-possession it provides is proof of nothing. The caller hands the
 * verifier straight to Convex and returns only the URL to the page.
 *
 * The client is registered per authorization rather than cached. That is a real
 * cost — an extra round trip, and a client record on the provider's side — and
 * it buys the property that matters here: this flow authorizes servers for
 * users who may never have signed in, so there is no durable account-scoped
 * place to keep a client id that would not itself need an owner.
