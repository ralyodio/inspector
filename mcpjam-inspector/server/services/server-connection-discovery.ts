/**
 * Unauthenticated discovery preflight for a connection request.
 *
 * A connection request arrives as a bare URL from a surface that has no server
 * row yet, and the first question is always the same: can we talk to this
 * thing, and if not, is the reason one we know how to fix by sending a person
 * to a consent screen? That is all discovery answers. It creates nothing,
 * stores nothing, and carries no credential.
 *
 * The probing itself is the SDK's `probeMcpServer` — the same prober the
 * server doctor runs — not a second one written here. Discovery classification
 * and the Inspector's own diagnostics must agree about what "this server needs
 * OAuth" means, and the only way to guarantee that is for both to ask the same
 * code.
 *
 * The prober rather than the whole doctor, for two reasons. Classification
 * reads `probe` and nothing else — the doctor's tool/resource/prompt
 * enumeration is work discovery never looks at. And the doctor's connect step
 * dials through MCPClientManager's own transport, which takes no `fetchFn`, so
 * it is the one outbound path the egress guard below cannot reach (the same
 * scope limit documented on `routes/shared/conformance.ts`). Dropping it
 * removes an unguarded socket rather than leaving one we would have to
 * apologise for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It does not acquire a work lease and it does not
 * report anything to the backend, because at the time of writing there is no
 * wire path for either — see NOTES-item-2.md. It is the half of the discovery
 * step that is fully determined by the Inspector, split out so it is testable
 * on its own and so the endpoint that eventually wraps it has nothing left to
 * decide except the round trips.

 * Whether a 401 is an MCP OAuth challenge we can actually act on.

 * as much to us as no challenge at all — and calling it `oauth` would strand
 * the request in `awaiting_authorization` with nowhere to send anyone.
 *
 * That single test covers two of the three unsupported shapes:
 *
 *   Basic/Digest/any non-Bearer scheme — no authorization server is named
 *   because the scheme has no concept of one.
 *
 *   Manual bearer — the server wants a token a human pastes in. It challenges
 *   with `Bearer` and publishes no authorization server metadata, because
 *   there is no flow to run.
 *
 * XAA IS A KNOWN GAP. An XAA server also challenges with `Bearer` and also
 * publishes authorization server metadata, so this test classifies it as
 * `oauth`. Separating the two needs an XAA-specific marker in the discovered
 * metadata, and which marker that should be is not settled — see
 * NOTES-item-2.md. Deliberately left misclassified rather than guessed at: a
 * wrong detector would refuse servers that do work.
 *
 * DO NOT ADD `registrationStrategies.length > 0` BACK AS AN ALTERNATIVE. An
 * earlier revision accepted it as a second sufficient condition, which
 * inverted the whole test: `server-probe.ts` returns
 * `registrationStrategies: ["preregistered"]` from the branch it takes when
 * metadata discovery THREW — so that list is non-empty in precisely the
 * manual-bearer and unknown-scheme cases this function exists to reject, and

 * multicast, documentation, NAT64-private or IPv4-mapped-private target, and a
 * non-http(s) scheme, before any socket exists. What it CANNOT do — as
 * `@mcpjam/sdk/oauth/node` says of it in as many words — is judge a bare public
 * hostname: `evil.example` passes the classifier and can still resolve to
 * 169.254.169.254. Classification alone leaves the rebinding window open.
 *
 * So the probe dials through the SDK's PINNED transport (`utils/pinned-fetch`,
 * over `@mcpjam/sdk/oauth/node`), which resolves the hostname once, refuses
 * private answers, pins the surviving addresses into the socket, and re-checks
 * EVERY redirect hop against the same rules. The redirect half is not optional:
 * a caller does not have to name the address they want reached — they can name
 * a host they control and have it answer `302 Location:
 * http://169.254.169.254/`, and a guard that inspects only the first URL is a
 * guard against typos.
 *
 * PINNING IS WHY THIS DOES NOT USE `createGuardedFetch` like the rest of the
 * server. That guard validates the DNS answer and then lets the HTTP client
 * resolve a second time — its own docblock says so — leaving a check-vs-connect
 * (TOCTOU) window. That punt is defensible for egress to hosts we chose; it is
 * not defensible here, where the hostname is supplied by whoever is asking us
 * to connect a server. The SDK entry that closes the window shipped one day
 * before this module and was always the intended transport.
 *
 * A blocked target is TERMINAL, not retryable — the address a URL names will
 * not become public on the next attempt. A resolver OUTAGE is retryable: DNS
 * blipping is not a verdict about the user's server, and treating it as one
 * would permanently fail a request over our own infrastructure trouble.
 *
 * No credential is ever attached. Discovery asks what a stranger sees.
