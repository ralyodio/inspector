/**
 * The worker that advances a connection request one step.
 *
 * The backend owns the state machine and decides what happens next; this owns
 * the part the backend cannot do — reaching an attacker-supplied URL over the
 * network. Every run is: take the lease, do exactly the step the lease response
 * named, report the outcome, release.
 *
 * THE WORKER NEVER DECIDES WHICH STEP TO RUN. It branches on the `status` the
 * lease returned, because the routing rule ("no project yet ⇒ wait", "OAuth ⇒
 * consent", "no auth ⇒ validate") lives in the backend's transition table where
 * it can be enforced. A worker that inferred the step from what it found on the
 * wire would be a second copy of that rule, free to disagree.
 *
 * FAILURE TAXONOMY IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE. Three outcomes look similar in a
 * stack trace and mean completely different things to a user:
 *
 *   retryable          the network misbehaved. Keep the credential, try again.
 *   authentication     the stored token was rejected. Only consent fixes it.
 *   terminal           the endpoint answered and is not a conformant MCP
 *                      server. Retrying changes nothing.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is expensive in both directions: classifying a blip as an
 * auth failure throws away a working grant, and classifying a bad endpoint as
 * retryable burns five attempts before saying so.
