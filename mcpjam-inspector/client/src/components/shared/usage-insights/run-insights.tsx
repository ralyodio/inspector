/**
 * Run insights — the answer, above the fold. One rail for Swarms and User
 * Testing.
 *
 * The two surfaces mine different populations but produce the SAME shape: a
 * deterministic signal, a registry finding that tracks it over time, and a
 * model explanation that enriches it. So the rail branches only on which
 * queries to read and how a detector phrases itself; everything about the
 * layout, the lifecycle, and the dismissal flow is shared.
 *
 * ONE list, not two. The deterministic miner and the model are two lanes over
 * the same problems, so rendering them as separate sections produced the same
 * finding twice in different words. Here each row is a SIGNAL — precise,
 * instant, backend-computed — that the model's explanation enriches when it
 * arrives. Nothing waits on generation to be readable, and nothing is said
 * twice.
 *
 * Collapsed rows are one line each so the whole picture fits without
 * scrolling; cause, fix, and evidence live behind the expand. Caveats
 * (coverage, partial analysis) sit in a single muted footer rather than
 * opening the summary, because a reader scanning for what to fix should not
 * have to read past a disclaimer to reach it.
