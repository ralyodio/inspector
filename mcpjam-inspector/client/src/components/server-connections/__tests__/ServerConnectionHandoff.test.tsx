/**
 * The handoff page.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the handling of the two values that must not linger:
 * the single-use handoff token, which has to leave the address bar the moment
 * it is spent, and the marker written before the OAuth redirect, which has to
 * be cleared the moment the callback is consumed. Both failures are invisible
 * in a working flow — the page looks identical either way — and both leave a
 * live artifact behind: a token in `history` that a share or a `Referer` can
 * carry, and a marker that hijacks the next unrelated `/oauth/callback` in the
 * same tab.
 *
 * The polling rule is here for the same reason: the page must stop asking on
 * every status the user has to act on, or it renders a spinner over a button
 * only they can press.
