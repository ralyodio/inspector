/**
 * Run-banner tone for a terminal run that produced no sessions.

 * The banner is the only thing most people read about a failed swarm, so what
 * it SAYS and how loudly it says it are both behaviour. A connect-time XAA
 * failure whose fix is "sign in again" must arrive as the server-named sentence
 * the server wrote, in the calm treatment — the dramatic red is reserved for
 * failures the user has to go and repair.
