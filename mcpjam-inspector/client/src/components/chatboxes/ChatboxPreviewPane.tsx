/**
 * The live published chatbox, embedded, so a scenario can be spot-checked
 * (chrome, welcome copy, tool flow) without leaving the page. Points at the
 * real share URL — the same one "Open" launches.
 *
 * Two things make the embed work at all, and both are easy to break:
 *
 *  - The self-embed is a deliberate exception to the misrouted-pushState
 *    guard in `main.tsx`, which matches on the tester-link PATHNAME shape
 *    (`lib/tester-link-path.ts`). Query params are fine; a shape change is
 *    not — change it there, where every matcher reads it from.
 *  - `isEmbeddedPreview()` (`lib/embedded-preview.ts`) makes the embedded
 *    runtime skip its sessionStorage writes. Without it the guest session
 *    leaks into the dashboard's own storage and the next reload boots the
 *    inspector into the tester's chatbox.
 *
 * Both guards key off same-origin, which is also the only way an embed can
 * render — a cross-origin share link (desktop builds, where the app isn't
 * served over http(s)) loads the remote app, which then renders its OWN
 * iframe guard. We check the origin here and offer the link instead, rather
 * than framing an error page.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION — the embed is not a faithful guest simulation, in two
 * ways this pane surfaces rather than hides:
 *
 *  - Same-origin means the frame shares the dashboard's WorkOS/Convex auth,
 *    so the runtime redeems the link as the signed-in member, not as an
 *    anonymous tester. Access-mode and sign-in behaviour a real guest hits
 *    are therefore NOT reproduced here. Hence the footnote.
 *  - Authorizing an OAuth-backed MCP server calls `window.location.assign`
 *    (`lib/oauth/mcp-oauth.ts`), which navigates THIS frame to the provider
 *    and returns to `/oauth/callback` — a path the `main.tsx` exemption
 *    deliberately does not cover, so the frame would land on
 *    `IframeRouterError`. We detect the frame leaving the chatbox path and
 *    hand the user back to a real browser tab, where the flow completes.
 *    Making OAuth work in-frame means changing where that redirect goes;
 *    that belongs in its own change, not silently in this one.
