/**
 * `/user-testing/new` — create a scenario by publishing an ENVIRONMENT behind
 * a share link.
 *
 * An environment already names the whole execution context a tester will meet:
 * the client, its servers, its skills, its sandbox image. So this screen asks
 * for the two things the environment does NOT carry — what to call the
 * scenario, and who may open it — and nothing else. The version this replaces
 * asked for a server and a client template and quietly minted a host, which is
 * why every project accumulated "scenarios" nobody made.
 *
 * **It never creates a NAMED environment.** Picking a saved one is the ordinary
 * path, and "New environment" hands off to the Environments editor with the
 * typed name seeded. What it also does is compose one on the spot: pick a client
 * and the shared slots, and Save resolves that into an unnamed,
 * content-addressed row. That is what makes "publish this same setup but on a
 * different client" a one-click change instead of a trip to /environments to
 * curate a second row.
 *
 * The strip is always offered — it renders behind `project-environments-enabled`
 * like the rest of this surface. Only RESOLVING a composed setup needs the
 * ad-hoc backend, and that is checked when Save uses it: hiding the control
 * instead would be indistinguishable from the feature not existing.
 *
 * **Nothing is written until Save.** Every choice is local state; the single
 * write is `onCreateScenario`, injected by the parent — the same inversion
 * `new-swarm-create-flow` and the legacy flow both use.
 *
 * **The environment is REQUIRED, and now says so.** A scenario is a link handed
 * to a person, and without an environment there is nothing behind that link —
 * the tester is the one who finds out. Save has always been gated on a target,
 * but silently: a disabled button that never explains itself reads as "I can
 * create a scenario without an environment", which is how this was reported.
 * The gate names itself here (marked labels, plus the hint under the strip), and
 * `ChatboxShareSection` holds the other end — a scenario whose environment stops
 * resolving issues no tester link.
