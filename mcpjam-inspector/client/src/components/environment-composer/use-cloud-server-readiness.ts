/**
 * Composer state → {@link CloudServerReadiness}, for surfaces that only run in
 * MCPJam's cloud.
 *
 * The mapping mirrors the backend resolver's server selection, and the two
 * halves of that rule are the reason this is not a one-liner: an environment (or
 * a composition) that names a server GROUP resolves to that group's servers,
 * while one that doesn't resolves to the CLIENT's own set. The group's members
 * come back as ids; a client's set is summarized by `hosts:listHosts` as a
 * count. {@link assessCloudServerReadiness} accepts both shapes and skips
 * whatever it cannot measure.
 *
 * Reads only queries the composer already subscribes to (clients, catalog,
 * groups), so this adds no round-trip to the surfaces that mount it.
