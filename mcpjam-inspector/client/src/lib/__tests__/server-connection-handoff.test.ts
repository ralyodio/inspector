/**
 * The handoff page's routing and its callback marker.
 *
 * These are small pure functions guarding two failures that are silent when
 * they happen: routing a request id as if it were a handoff token, which burns
 * a single-use claim that could never have succeeded; and letting a connection
 * flow's marker capture an `/oauth/callback` that belonged to the Inspector's
 * own OAuth flow, which would post someone else's `state` to the wrong
 * endpoint.
