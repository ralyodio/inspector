 * only, which means they surface just as context on some LATER event and
 * produce no issue of their own. `crashed` and `oom` are ones a desktop user
 * actually experiences as "the app broke", so they are promoted to events
 * here.
 *
 * `killed` stays out: the OS kills Electron's own utility processes under
 * memory pressure on a busy machine, Electron respawns them, and the user
 * sees nothing. Capturing it produced issues about the reporter's hardware
 * rather than about the app. It remains a breadcrumb, so it still shows up
 * as context if a real failure follows.
 *
 * `clean-exit` stays out: that is a normal shutdown.
