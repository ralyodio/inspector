/**
 * MCPJam Public API — v1 contract (shared source of truth).
 *
 * Framework-agnostic: NO Hono, Convex, or Node imports, and no runtime
 * dependencies, so every public-API surface can import it cheaply (the same
 * discipline as `@mcpjam/sdk/host-config/internal`). It defines the wire
 * contract — the error-code union, the code -> HTTP-status map, the
 * internal -> public code mapping, and the envelope/pagination builders.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - the Inspector Hono gateway (`mcpjam-inspector/server/routes/v1`) imports
 *     this and adapts it to `c.json(...)` in its `envelope.ts`.
 *   - the Convex backend (`mcpjam-backend/convex/publicApi`) will consume this
 *     once its pinned `@mcpjam/sdk` version includes the subpath; until then it
 *     keeps a byte-identical local copy, cross-checked by golden fixtures.
 *
 * Envelope rules:
 *   - success (single resource) -> the resource object directly
 *   - success (collection)      -> { items, nextCursor? }   (cursor-based)
 *   - error                     -> { code, message, details? }  + HTTP status
 *
 * Framework-specific response helpers (Hono `c.json`, platform `Response`)
 * intentionally live with each consumer, not here. So does anything a
 * particular HOST needs: the agent types below carry a kind and a severity,
 * never Slack wording or Block Kit — a second wrapper must be a rendering
 * file, not a protocol change.
 */

/**
 * Canonical v1 public error-code union.
 *
 * Reconciliation note: the Inspector Node already ships
 * UNAUTHORIZED/FORBIDDEN/NOT_FOUND/VALIDATION_ERROR/RATE_LIMITED/
 * FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED/SERVER_UNREACHABLE/TIMEOUT/INTERNAL_ERROR (see
 * routes/web/errors.ts `ErrorCode`). The public union adopts those verbatim and
 * adds OAUTH_REQUIRED so callers (our MCP worker, CLI, agents) can distinguish
 * "this server needs an OAuth grant" from a generic 401. Draft-only codes
 * UPSTREAM_ERROR/TOOL_TIMEOUT are NOT public; they collapse to
 * SERVER_UNREACHABLE/TIMEOUT at the boundary (see INTERNAL_TO_V1_CODE). Adding
 * codes is backward-compatible; removing or repurposing one is breaking.
 *
 * CONFLICT (409) covers a write rejected because the resource is not in a state
 * that accepts it — the caller's request was well-formed, so VALIDATION_ERROR
 * would misreport it, and retrying verbatim will not help. Project Environments
 * are the first surface to need it: they use optimistic concurrency, so a stale
 * `expectedRevision` must be distinguishable from bad input. It also carries the
 * environment name collisions and archive-state rejections the backend reports
 * with the same code, and the run-start `ENVIRONMENT_REVISION_CONFLICT`, which
 * previously had no public mapping and so surfaced as a 500.
