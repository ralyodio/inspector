 * shape, canonicalizer, and hash.
 *
 * The canonicalizer is no longer hand-mirrored: mcpjam-backend PR #409
 * collapsed the mirror into a one-import delegation, so
 * `convex/lib/hostConfigV2.ts` IMPORTS `canonicalizeHostConfigV2` from
 * `@mcpjam/sdk/host-config/internal`. There is exactly one canonicalizer and
 * one golden-vector fixture (`sdk/tests/host-config-parity.test.ts`) — no
 * cross-repo parity ritual, and nothing to regenerate unless you
 * intentionally change an existing vector's canonical output.
 *
 * The backend does still hand-mirror the TYPES and, more importantly, keeps
 * an explicit persistence projection that copies known fields onto the stored
 * document. A new optional field added here is hashed by the shared
 * canonicalizer but will NOT be persisted until that projection and the
 * Convex validator learn about it — so ship the backend half in the same
 * change set as anything that must round-trip.
 *
 * Pure + browser-safe: no `convex/values`, no `ctx.db`, no Node-only APIs.

// Siblings of `toolParamHeaderMirroring`: each field models a way REAL

// through a specific client's eyes. Shared rules:
//
// - Absent = the spec-conforming/full behavior, and the field is OMITTED
//   from canonical output, so pre-feature rows keep their hash. The
//   conforming literal is storable but hashes distinctly; UIs write absence.
// - Each knob is a property of the simulated CLIENT, so it lives here
//   rather than on `serverConnectionOverrides`.
// - Enforcement is era- and transport-scoped: a knob whose mechanism
//   doesn't exist on the negotiated era (or on stdio) is silently inert.
//
// Deliberately NOT modeled here (each was considered and rejected):
// - `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name` emission — the official client attaches these
//   on every modern enveloped request with no browser carve-out, so every
//   SDK-built client sends them. (Only `Mcp-Param-*` mirroring is browser-
//   gated, which is why `toolParamHeaderMirroring` exists and this does
//   not.) "What does my server do without them" is conformance-harness
//   territory, which already sends hostile frames outside the client.
// - A vestigial `Mcp-Session-Id`, or per-request `_meta` sent only on the
//   first request — no real client does either; the SDKs handle both.
// - `requestState` echo fidelity — synthetic fault injection against the
//   server's integrity check; belongs to the conformance harness.
// - Elicitation form/url support — already modeled, as
//   `clientCapabilities.elicitation.{form,url}`. Do not duplicate it here.
// - list_changed handling — a real divergence between hosts, but making
//   MCPJam's own tool list go stale is an anti-feature for a debugger.
//   It belongs in the host catalog as a fact to DISPLAY about a host, not
//   as a behavior to simulate.

/**

 * - `"firstPageOnly"` — treat page one as the complete result, the way
 *   several real hosts notoriously do. Lets a server author answer "do my
 *   important tools survive a first-page-only host?".
 *
 * Deliberate interaction: the SEP-2243 `Mcp-Param-*` mirroring source is

 * for page-one tools — which is exactly how such a client really behaves.
