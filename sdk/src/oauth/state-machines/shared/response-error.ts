 * The flow error for a rejected authenticated request — the debugger's last

 *
 * Status line first so the shape is unchanged, then the server's own reason
 * when the body carries one. Every protocol era ends on that step (older ones
 * with `initialize`, 2026-07-28 with `tools/list`), so they all report it the
 * same way.
 *
 * The reason is redacted here rather than at each display: it is text the
 * server under test chose, and MCPJam is routinely pointed at half-built
 * servers that echo the bearer token back in an error body. This value becomes
 * `state.error`, which is toasted, folded into conformance step results, and
 * reported — the full body stays readable in HTTP history either way.
 *
 * The redactor receives the whole reason and caps it, rather than being handed
 * a pre-cut one: it closes an unterminated JSON value or URL userinfo only when
 * it made the cut itself, so cutting first would strand the raw head of a
 * credential whose closing delimiter sat just past the cap. Its own scan window
 * (`MAX_SCANNED`) bounds the work, so a megabyte body costs one slice.
 *
 * Whitespace is collapsed last, on that capped output: the flow error renders
 * in a toast and titles an error-report group, so a stack trace or an HTML page
 * must not carry its newlines in — and collapsing before the cap would scan the
 * whole body to do it.
